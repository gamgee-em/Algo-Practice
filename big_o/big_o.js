//* Using Big O to Compare Algorithms

// O(1) --> Constant Time Complexity 
// n (number of input) has no effect on the time the algorithm takes

// O(log n) --> Logarithmic Time Complexity
// Execution time grows logarithmaically with n

// O(n) --> Linear Time Complexity
// Execution time grows linearly with n

// O(n2) --> Quadratic Time Complexity
// Execution time grows quadratically with n
